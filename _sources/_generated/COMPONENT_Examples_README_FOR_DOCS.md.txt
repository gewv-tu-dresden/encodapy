# Examples of EnCoDaPy usage

This folder contains a number of examples to provide a documentation of the use of EnCoDaPy, which should explain the use for the individual services. The following aspects are addressed:

- [01_config](https://github.com/gewv-tu-dresden/encodapy/blob/main/examples/01_config): Configuration of the service
- [02_datatransfer](https://github.com/gewv-tu-dresden/encodapy/blob/main/examples/02_datatransfer): Data transfer between basic service and individual functions
- [03_interfaces](https://github.com/gewv-tu-dresden/encodapy/blob/main/examples/03_interfaces): Documentation of possible interfaces
- [04_simple_service_fiware](https://github.com/gewv-tu-dresden/encodapy/blob/main/examples/04_simple_service_fiware): A simple service as an example of how the basic service could be extended to a custom service (by adding additional code) using the fiware interface
- [05_simple_service_mqtt](https://github.com/gewv-tu-dresden/encodapy/blob/main/examples/05_simple_service_mqtt): A simple service as an example of how the basic service could be extended to a custom service (by adding additional code) using the mqtt interface
- [06_thermal_storage_service](https://github.com/gewv-tu-dresden/encodapy/blob/main/examples/06_thermal_storage_service): This is an example of a service that calculates the thermal energy in a thermal storage tank using a component of the framework.
- [07_component_runner](https://github.com/gewv-tu-dresden/encodapy/blob/main/examples/07_component_runner): An example of how to run the service using only the configuration. **This is the suggested way to use the framework**
- [08_create_new_component](https://github.com/gewv-tu-dresden/encodapy/blob/main/examples/08_create_new_component): This is an example of how to create your own component and use it with the Component Runner from Example [07_component_runner](https://github.com/gewv-tu-dresden/encodapy/blob/main/examples/07_component_runner).
