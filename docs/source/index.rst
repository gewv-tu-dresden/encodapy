EnCoDaPy Documentation
=============================

Welcome to the EnCoDaPy (Energy Component Data Python) documentation!

Overview
--------

EnCoDaPy is a Python framework for the configuration and management of energy system components. 
It provides a comprehensive solution for:

* **Configuration Management**: Structured models for system and component configurations
* **Data Integration**: Support for various interfaces (MQTT, FIWARE, File)
* **Component Control**: Modular architecture for energy system components
* **Data Validation**: Pydantic-based models for robust data processing

Key Features
------------

**Flexible Interfaces**
  Supports MQTT, FIWARE, and file-based communication for maximum interoperability.

**Typed Configuration**
  Fully typed configuration models with automatic validation and documentation.

**Modular Components**
  Extensible architecture for various energy system components like thermal storage and controllers.

**Time-based Control**
  Configurable time and sampling settings for calculations and calibration.
