# Examples of EnCoDaPy usage

This folder contains a number of examples to provide a documentation of the use of EnCoDaPy, which should explain the use for the individual services. The following aspects are addressed:

- [01_config](./01_config/): Configuration of the service
- [02_datatransfer](./02_datatransfer/): Data transfer between basic service and individual functions
- [03_interfaces](./03_interfaces/): Documentation of possible interfaces
- [04_simple_service_fiware](./04_simple_service_fiware/): A simple service as an example of how the basic service could be extended to a custom service (by adding additional code) using the fiware interface
- [05_simple_service_mqtt](./05_simple_service_mqtt/): A simple service as an example of how the basic service could be extended to a custom service (by adding additional code) using the mqtt interface
- [06_thermal_storage_service](./06_thermal_storage_service/): This is an example of a service that calculates the thermal energy in a thermal storage tank using a component of the framework.
- [07_component_runner](./07_component_runner/): An example of how to run the service using only the configuration. **This is the suggested way to use the framework.**
- [08_create_new_component](./08_create_new_component/): Example of how to create your own component and use it with the Component Runner.
